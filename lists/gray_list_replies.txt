so, if you’re a captain and i’m a jedi, then, technically, i outrank you, right?:In my book, experience outranks everything.
as a jedi, we were trained to be keepers of the peace, not soldiers. but all i've been since a padawan is a soldier.:Well, I've known no other way. Gives us clones all a mixed feeling about the war. Many people wish it never happened. But without it, we clones wouldn't exist.
rex? are you okay?:Yeah. Yeah, kid. I'm okay. I'm sorry for what happened earlier. I almost killed you.
how widespread is this?:Ahsoka, it's all of us. The entire Grand Army of the Republic has been ordered to hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.
they’re too many. besides, i don’t wanna hurt them.:I hate to tell you this, but they don’t care. This ship is going down, and those soldiers, my brothers, are willing to die and take you and me along with them.
i'm the new padawan learner. i'm ahsoka tano:Hey, Kid.
